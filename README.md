### Description
This is an edition of personal website in a public repository. This is not my current "production" website hosted at haydenmiedema.com. This is a responsive website that uses some Unify templates and Bootstrap. It is written in just HTML, Javascript (jQuery and a bit of Angular), and CSS.

My current working website is hosted in a private repositor and isn't quite as flashy in terms of looks. I am working on a one page application using AngularJS and Typescript that does all page rendering asynchronously.
