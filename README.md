This is my current personal website in a public repository. Most of my updates are in a private repository, so this is general a few versions
behind my current "production" website.

This version is written using AngularJS and Typescript. The application uses dynamic routing and is a one page application. The different
page links are done asynchronously, and do not require a page refresh.
